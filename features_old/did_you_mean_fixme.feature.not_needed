Feature: NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:  Did You Mean (Stanford)
  As a user
  In order to find the resources I want
  I want to get useful suggestions when I mistype or misspell queries
  
  Scenario: kvetsh --> kvetch
    Given a SOLR index with Stanford MARC data
    When I am on the home page
    And I fill in "q" with "kvetsh"
    And I press "search"
    Then I should see "Did you mean"
    When I follow "kvetch"
    Then I should get at least 3 results
