Gillmer, a world-renowned designer of yachts and historic replica ships, and an internationally recognized authority on the history of naval architecture."','"Aided by hundreds of rare photographs and the incomparable drawings of William Gilkerson and Tom Price, Gillmer documents the origins of European and North American workboats - humble craft whose history, lineage, and survival today provide important keys to understanding the emergence of Western Civilization."','"Gillmer brings into focus nearly 5,000 years of workboat evolution, tracing the development of boatbuilding techniques and the civilizations that produced them. He begins with the sea-going boats of the Minoans and the old Norse, and then explores the growth of boatbuilding technology in the separately evolving maritime cultures of Northern Europe, the British Isles, the Mediterranean, the Iberian Peninsula, and North America."','"When Working Watercraft was first published in 1972 it provided a historic record of these humble workboats that has yet to be equaled, and was hailed as "a book to treasure" by Nautical Magazine. Motor Boating & Sailing said "all of us owe Mr. Gillmer a debt of gratitude for his thoughtful record.""','"Since then, the body of maritime knowledge has expanded enormously, bringing new light to Gillmer\'s original research. Technological innovations have given underwater archaeologists new capabilities, allowing them to reach into depths that had been a secure vault of the unknown. One group has recently recovered a cargo ship that sank in the eastern Mediterranean during the Bronze Age - before Hercules was conceived or Ulysses sailed for Troy','Archaeologists revealed that the wooden hull had a keel - the center structural beam that did not exist in any contemporary Egyptian ships. And knowledge of Norse watercraft - limited before 1972 to only two ships - has been expanded greatly with the discovery of five ships in a Danish fjord near Roskilde."','"A strong thread runs through the evolution of the West\'s maritime cultures; old methods of boatbuilding and design can still be seen in existing craft, but the thread is becoming frayed. Some of the existing craft Gillmer wrote about as recently as 1972 are now gone. Working Watercraft is a record of vanishing and vanished boats of historic significance - the story of Western Civilization as told by its everyday working craft."--BOOK JACKET'],'title_display'=>['A history of working watercraft of the western world'],'clio_id_display'=>'1570909','subject_topic_facet'=>['Work boats'],'pub_place_display'=>['Camden, Me'],'format'=>['Book'],'oclc_display'=>['ocm29843577'],'full_publisher_display'=>['Camden, Me. : International Marine, c1994.'],'isbn_display'=>['007023616X'],'pub_year_display'=>['c1994'],'id'=>'1570909','author_display'=>['Gillmer, Thomas C., 1911-2009'],'pub_name_display'=>['International Marine'],'source_display'=>['catalog'],'material_type_display'=>['xii, 276 p.'],'language_facet'=>['English'],'score'=>0.0011553321},{'location_call_number_id_display'=>['Butler Stacks (Enter at the Butler Circulation Desk) >> KF368.L52 S68 2002|DELIM|3794691'],'lccn_display'=>['2001005114'],'summary_display'=>['"Abraham Lincoln has long been considered the greatest president by scholars of American history. According to legal scholars, he could just as easily have been one of the foremost lawyers in the nation had he not become president."','"Lincoln practiced law for about twenty-five years, mainly in the circuit courts of Illinois. However, he was hardly a hick country lawyer. In contrast, Lincoln was an incisive, determined, and assertive litigator with an overwhelming caseload. He sought out new business for his law firm and cared about earning a comfortable living."','"A ten-year research project, the Lincoln Legal Papers, discovered thousands of yellowed legal documents in musty and dusty courtroom basements. Those handwritten legal papers related to more than 5,000 cases that Lincoln handled, more than 400 before the supreme court of Illinois. In addition, Lincoln appeared before justices of the peace, circuit court judges, and even the Supreme Court of the United States."','"For the first time, this book uses the newly discovered legal documents to tell the story of more than sixty of Lincoln\'s cases. Many of these cases have never been written about previously. Allen D.','Spiegel describes how Lincoln the lawyer handled a staggering variety of cases involving arbitration, assault and battery, bad debt, bankruptcy, bastardy, bestiality, breach of marriage, divorce, impeachment of an Illinois justice, insanity, land titles, libel, medical malpractice, murder, partnership dissolution, patent infringement, personal injuries, property damages, rape, railroad bonds, sexual slander, slave ownership, and wrongful dismissal."--BOOK JACKET'],'title_display'=>['A.
