// This is a manifest file for the JS that's specific
// to loading Angular, and for features built on Angular.

// This will only be loaded when the layout file says:
//    javascript_include_tag 'angular'
// The rest of the app doesn't have to load this.

// based on:
// http://www.foraker.com/rails-asset-pipeline-handling-of-css-and-js/

// This comes from the angularjs-rails gem
//= require angular
//= require angular-resource
//= require angular-sanitize

//= require_tree ./angular-support
